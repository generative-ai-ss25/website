## Course info

|           | Day       | Time              | Location |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| Lecture   |  Wednesday   | 08:15  - 10:30  |  [Room S205](https://www.hdm-stuttgart.de/horst)  |



## Learning objectives

The course focuses on exploring and realizing the potential of LLMs to automate various business tasks. In particular, we will investigate how LLMs can be used to automate routine tasks such as composing emails and creating reports.

By the end of the semester, you will be able to use popular frameworks like OpenAI Models and Gradio to build agentic LLM applications.


## Teams

You will be assigned to a team at the beginning of the semester.

All team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of the project and you will be asked to evaluate your team members throughout the semester. Failure to adequately contribute to an assignment will result in a penalty to your mark relative to the team's overall mark.

You are expected to make use of the provided GitHub repository as the central collaborative platform. [Commits](https://github.com/git-guides/git-commit) to this repository will be used as a metric (one of several) of each team member's relative contribution for each project.


## Assessment

Assessment for the course is comprised of two components:

- Acquisition of a skill badge (ungraded)
- Project (all prototypes must be done in Python, and all components of the project **must be reproducible** (with the exception of the final presentation) placed inside a GitHub repo.
)


**Skill badge**:

Earn a Google Cloud skill badge by completing the [Introduction to Generative AI, Introduction to Large Language Models and Introduction to Responsible AI](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/536) courses. 

By passing the final quiz, you'll demonstrate your understanding of foundational concepts in generative AI.

A skill badge is a digital badge issued by Google Cloud in recognition of your knowledge of Google Cloud products and services. 

**Project**:  

The purpose of the project is to build and present an agentic LLM application. The project will be completed in teams.

## Course policies

### Academic integrity

**TL;DR: Don't cheat!**

All students must adhere to the academic integrity standard. Students affirm their commitment to uphold the values by signing a pledge that states:

-   I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
-   I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors;
-   I will act if the standard is compromised

Regardless of the course delivery format, it is your responsibility to understand and follow HdM policies regarding academic integrity, including doing one's own work, following proper citation of sources, and adhering to guidance around group work projects.
