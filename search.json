    "text": "Project Phases\n\n1. Use Case Identification (Weeks 1-2)\nBegin by identifying three potential business use cases where generative AI agents could provide significant value. Evaluate each option based on:\n\nBusiness relevance and potential impact\nTechnical feasibility within the course timeframe\nAvailability of necessary data and resources\nAlignment with course concepts\n\nSubmit a brief analysis (1-2 pages) of your three ideas with justification for each. We will discuss the options and select one use case to pursue.\n\n\n2. Business Context Development (Weeks 2-3)\nOnce your use case is approved, develop a comprehensive business context presentation using Google Slides with an appropriate business template. Your 10-minute presentation should include:\n\nBusiness Model Canvas for the organization\nValue Proposition Canvas for the AI solution\nUser Personas for primary stakeholders/users\nSpecific KPIs that will measure success\n\n\n\n3. Agent System Design (Weeks 4-5)\nDesign your generative AI agent system, focusing on:\n\nAgent architecture (perception, reasoning, action, learning components)\nLLM selection strategy with justification (OpenAI, Anthropic, or HuggingFace)\nPrompt engineering approach\nIntegration points with existing business processes\nData flow and system boundaries\nSecurity and ethical considerations\n\nSubmit a design document (3-5 pages) and architecture diagram for feedback before proceeding to implementation.\n\n\n4. Technical Implementation (Weeks 6-9)\nImplement your generative AI agent system following these guidelines:\n\nDevelop in Python with modular, well-documented code\nImplement using selected AI frameworks (OpenAI, Anthropic, or HuggingFace)\nCreate an intuitive user interface using one of the specified frontend solutions\nInclude comprehensive error handling and robustness measures\nEstablish integration points with business processes\nImplement metrics tracking for performance evaluation\nSet up a GitHub repository with clear documentation\n\nWeekly code reviews will be conducted to provide feedback and guidance.\n\n\n5. Testing and Evaluation (Weeks 10-11)\nThoroughly test your system and evaluate its performance:\n\nConduct functional testing across various scenarios\nMeasure performance against established KPIs\nDocument limitations and edge cases\nGather feedback from potential users\nQuantify business impact (time savings, quality improvements, etc.)\nIdentify potential improvements and future enhancements\n\nSubmit a testing report (2-3 pages) documenting your findings.\n\n\n6. Final Documentation and Presentation (Weeks 12-13)\nPrepare comprehensive documentation and a final presentation:\n\nComplete technical documentation including:\n\nSystem architecture\nImplementation details\nUser manual\nInstallation and setup instructions\nAPI documentation (if applicable)\nFuture enhancement roadmap\n\nDeliver a 15-minute final presentation that:\n\nExplains the business use case and value proposition\nDemonstrates the working prototype\nPresents evaluation results and impact metrics\nDiscusses challenges and lessons learned\nOutlines potential future developments",
