It helps manage dependencies, keeps your projects organized, and provides powerful tools that make coding easier and more enjoyable. The uv package manager we’ll be using is a modern, fast alternative to traditional Python package managers.\n\nStep 1: Apply for GitHub Student Developer Pack 🎓\nThe GitHub Student Developer Pack provides students with free access to the best developer tools.\n\nVisit GitHub Student Developer Pack\n\nClick on “Get your pack”\n\nSign in with your GitHub account (or create one if you don’t have it)\nVerify your student status using your school-issued email\nComplete the application form\nWait for approval (usually takes 1-7 days)\n\nWhy this matters: The pack includes free access to GitHub Copilot, which is an AI pair programmer that will help you write better code faster.\n\n\nStep 2: Install Visual Studio Code 💻\nVS Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro Tip for Microsoft\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring installation on Windows, check the options “Add ‘Open with Code’ action to Windows Explorer file context menu” and “Add ‘Open with Code’ action to Windows Explorer directory context menu” for easier access.\n\n\n\n\nGo to VS Code download page\nDownload the appropriate version for your operating system\nRun the installer and follow the on-screen instructions\nLaunch VS Code after installation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro Tip for Mac\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be able to open VS Code from the command line interface using code . command:\n\nOpen VS Code\nPress Cmd+Shift+P to open the Command Palette\nType “shell command” and select “Shell Command: Install ‘code’ command in PATH”\nRestart your terminal for changes to take effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Install Essential VS Code Extensions 🧩\nExtensions enhance VS Code with additional features. We’ll install three key extensions.\nIn VS Code, click on the Extensions icon in the sidebar (or press: Windows Ctrl+Shift+X / mac: Cmd+Shift+X).\nPython Extension\n\nSearch for “Python”\nFind the extension by Microsoft (usually the first result)\nClick “Install”\n\nGitHub Copilot\n\nSearch for “GitHub Copilot” in the Extensions marketplace\nClick “Install”\nAfter installation, sign in with your GitHub account using the account icon in the lower left sidebar\nYou’ll be prompted to authorize VS Code to use GitHub Copilot\n\nGitHub Copilot Chat\n\nSearch for “GitHub Copilot Chat” in the Extensions marketplace\nClick “Install”\nThis extension works alongside GitHub Copilot to provide conversational AI assistance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: GitHub Copilot requires a subscription, but it’s free with the GitHub Student Developer Pack you applied for in Step 1.\n\n\n\nYou can enhance Copilot’s chat responses by providing it with contextual details about your workflow, tools, or project specifics. Instead of manually including this context in every chat query, you can create a custom instructions file that automatically incorporates this information with every chat request.\n\nCustom instructions for GitHub Copilot in VS Code\n\n\n\nStep 4: Install uv Package Manager ⚡\nuv is a fast, modern Python package manager and resolver.\nFor Windows (PowerShell):\n\nOpen PowerShell\nRun the following command:\n\npowershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c \"irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex\"\n\nRestart your PowerShell session to ensure uv is in your PATH\n\nFor macOS/Linux (Terminal):\n\nOpen Terminal\nRun the following command:\n\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\nIf your system doesn’t have curl, you can use wget:\nwget -qO- https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n\nClose and reopen your terminal to ensure uv is in your PATH\n\nVerify installation: Type uv --version in your command line interface. You should see the version number of uv displayed.\n\n\nStep 5: Initialize Your First Project\nNow let’s create a new Python project structure using uv:\n\nOpen your command line interface (PowerShell on Windows or Terminal on Mac/Linux)\nSimply type the following command directly in your command line or first navigate to the directory where you want to create your project (e.g., cd Documents)\nRun the following command to initialize a new project named “genai-app” with Python 3.11:\n\nuv init genai-app --python 3.11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat this does\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreates a new directory called genai-app\nSets up a project structure with Python 3.11\nCreates initial configuration files\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 6: Navigate to Your Project Directory 📁\nLet’s move into your newly created project directory:\ncd genai-app\nCheck the directory contents: You can use dir (Windows) or ls (macOS/Linux) to see what files were created.\n\n\nStep 7: Activate your Virtual Python Environment 🔄\nA virtual environment is an isolated space where you can install packages without affecting your global Python installation. We can create and activate this environment with:\nuv sync\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat this does\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreates a virtual environment for your project\nSets up the environment based on your project’s specifications\nThis environment is isolated from your system Python installation\n\n\n\n\nLet’s execute the example Python file main.py to make sure everything is working:\npython main.py\nYou should see a “Hello, world” message.\nIf you get an error, try using python3 instead of python:\npython3 main.py\n\n\nStep 8: Install Required Packages 📦\nLet’s add some commonly used packages for AI and data science projects:\nuv add pandas python-dotenv openai gradio streamlit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat these packages do\n\n\n\n\n\n\npandas: A beginner-friendly library that helps you work with data tables (like Excel spreadsheets)\npython-dotenv: Helps keep your passwords and API keys safe by storing them in a separate file\nopenai: Connects your code to AI services like ChatGPT\ngradio: Creates simple web interfaces for your AI projects with minimal coding\nstreamlit: Turns your Python scripts into interactive web apps with just a few lines of code\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 9: Open your project in VS Code\nNow let’s open your new project in VS Code where we’ll write our code:\n\nOpen VS Code\nClick on “File” in the top menu on the left\nSelect “Open Folder…”\nFind and select your genai-app folder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro Tip\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you’re in your command line, this command opens VS Code in your current directory (the . represents “current location”).\ncode .\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 10: Run Your First Python Program 🏃‍♀️\nLet’s make sure everything is working by running the example file:\npython3 main.py\nYou should see a “Hello, world!” message appear. This confirms that: 1. Your Python is working correctly 2. Your virtual environment is active 3. You’re ready to start coding!\n\n\nTroubleshooting Common Issues 🔧\nPackage Installation Problems\nIf you see errors when adding packages:\n\nCheck that you’re connected to the internet\nTry running uv sync again to refresh your environment\nRead the error message carefully - it often tells you exactly what went wrong\n\n“Command Not Found” Error\nIf your computer can’t find the uv command:\n\nClose your terminal completely and open a new one\nIf that doesn’t work, you might need to add uv to your PATH (the list of places your computer looks for programs)\nAs a last resort, try reinstalling using the commands from Step 4\n\nVS Code Extensions Not Working\nIf the extensions we installed aren’t behaving correctly:\n\nMake sure you’ve signed in to your GitHub account in VS Code\nTry updating VS Code to the latest version\nYou can reinstall extensions by uninstalling them first, then installing again\n\n\n\nAdditional Resources 📖\n\nuv Documentation\nVS Code Python Tutorial\n\n\n\nConclusion 🎯\nCongratulations! You’ve successfully set up a Python development environment using uv. This modern setup will serve you well as you progress in your programming journey. Remember that learning to code is a marathon, not a sprint – take your time to understand each concept thoroughly.\nHappy coding! 💻✨",

For the Global Bike Inc. (GBI) AI agent implementation project, this framework will help us identify how generative AI solutions can create value across the company’s operations. The canvas enables a holistic view of GBI’s business aspects, from value propositions to revenue streams, and helps understand relationships between these elements.\nAs AI consultants to GBI, using the BMC will facilitate evaluating potential AI agent implementations, reconsidering existing business processes, and planning strategic adjustments. This approach promotes innovative thinking and helps identify optimization opportunities across GBI’s bicycle manufacturing and accessories business, ensuring our AI solution design is customer-oriented and aligns with GBI’s strategic objectives.\nIn the rapidly changing landscape of both bicycle manufacturing and AI implementation, the Business Model Canvas offers the flexibility needed to adapt to new circumstances while maintaining focus on long-term business value."
