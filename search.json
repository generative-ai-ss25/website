    "text": "Project Phases\n\n1. Use Case Identification (Weeks 1-2)\nBegin by exploring GBI’s business operations through the provided SQL server data. Identify three potential business use cases where generative AI agents could provide significant value to GBI. Focus on areas such as:\n\nSales process optimization: Enhancing customer interactions, order processing, or sales forecasting\nSupply chain intelligence: Improving inventory management, procurement, or supplier communications\nProduction efficiency: Optimizing manufacturing processes, quality control, or maintenance scheduling\nCustomer service automation: Creating intelligent support systems for customer inquiries or warranty claims\nProduct development: Assisting in market analysis, design feedback, or feature prioritization\n\nEvaluate each option based on: - Business relevance and potential impact for GBI - Technical feasibility within the course timeframe - Availability of necessary data in the GBI SQL server - Alignment with course concepts\nSubmit a brief analysis (1-2 pages) of your three ideas with justification for each, explaining how they could enhance GBI’s operations. We will discuss the options and select one use case to pursue.\n\n\n2. Business Context Development (Weeks 2-3)\nOnce your use case is approved, develop a comprehensive business context presentation using Google Slides with an appropriate business template. Your 10-minute presentation should include:\n\nBusiness Model Canvas for the organization\nUser Personas for primary stakeholders/users\nValue Proposition Canvas and the Jobs-to-be-done Framework for the AI solution\nSpecific KPIs that will measure success\n\n\n\n3. Agent System Design (Weeks 4-6)\nDesign your generative AI agent system, focusing on:\n\nAgent architecture (perception, reasoning, action, learning components)\nLLM selection strategy with justification (OpenAI, Anthropic, or HuggingFace)\nPrompt engineering approach\nIntegration points with existing business processes\nData flow and system boundaries\nSecurity and ethical considerations\n\nSubmit a design document (3-5 pages) and architecture diagram for feedback before proceeding to implementation.\n\n\n4. Technical Implementation (Weeks 7-11)\nImplement your generative AI agent system for GBI following these guidelines:\n\nDevelop in Python with modular, well-documented code\nImplement using selected AI frameworks (OpenAI, Anthropic, or HuggingFace)\nCreate an intuitive user interface using one of the specified frontend solutions\nInclude comprehensive error handling and robustness measures\nEstablish integration points with GBI’s business processes\nImplement connection to the GBI SQL Server to access and process relevant business data\nDesign database queries that efficiently extract the necessary information\nConsider implementation of new systems (like CRM, analytics dashboards, etc.) if appropriate for your solution\nImplement metrics tracking for performance evaluation\nSet up a GitHub repository with clear documentation\n\nYour solution should either integrate with GBI’s existing data structure or propose new systems that would enhance their operations. While you will use the SQL Server as your primary data source, you are encouraged to explore implementing complementary systems that would address gaps in GBI’s current operations.\nWeekly code reviews will be conducted to provide feedback and guidance.\n\n\n5. Testing and Evaluation (Weeks 12-13)\nThoroughly test your system and evaluate its performance:\n\nConduct functional testing across various scenarios\nMeasure performance against established KPIs\nDocument limitations and edge cases\nGather feedback from potential users\nQuantify business impact (time savings, quality improvements, etc.)\nIdentify potential improvements and future enhancements\n\nSubmit a testing report (2-3 pages) documenting your findings.\n\n\n6. Final Documentation and Presentation (Weeks 14-15)\nPrepare comprehensive documentation and a final presentation:\n\nComplete technical documentation including:\n\nSystem architecture\nImplementation details\nUser manual\nInstallation and setup instructions\nAPI documentation (if applicable)\nFuture enhancement roadmap\n\nDeliver a 15-minute final presentation that:\n\nExplains the business use case and value proposition\nDemonstrates the working prototype\nPresents evaluation results and impact metrics\nDiscusses challenges and lessons learned\nOutlines potential future developments",

    "section": "Python Setup with uv",
    "text": "Python Setup with uv\nWelcome to this guide on setting up your Python development environment using the powerful package manager called uv.\nA properly configured development environment is crucial for efficient coding. It helps manage dependencies, keeps your projects organized, and provides powerful tools that make coding easier and more enjoyable. The uv package manager we’ll be using is a modern, fast alternative to traditional Python package managers.\n\nStep 1: Apply for GitHub Student Developer Pack 🎓\nThe GitHub Student Developer Pack provides students with free access to the best developer tools.\n\nVisit GitHub Student Developer Pack\n\nClick on “Get your pack”\n\nSign in with your GitHub account (or create one if you don’t have it)\nVerify your student status using your school-issued email\nComplete the application form\nWait for approval (usually takes 1-7 days)\n\nWhy this matters: The pack includes free access to GitHub Copilot, which is an AI pair programmer that will help you write better code faster.\n\n\nStep 2: Install Visual Studio Code 💻\nVS Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor.\n\nGo to VS Code download page\nDownload the appropriate version for your operating system\nRun the installer and follow the on-screen instructions\nLaunch VS Code after installation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro Tip for Microsoft\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring installation on Windows, check the options “Add ‘Open with Code’ action to Windows Explorer file context menu” and “Add ‘Open with Code’ action to Windows Explorer directory context menu” for easier access.\n\n\n\nAdding VS Code to PATH (Command Line Access)\nTo be able to open VS Code from the command line interface using code . command:\nFor Windows:\n\nOpen VS Code\nPress Ctrl+Shift+P to open the Command Palette\nType “shell command” and select “Shell Command: Install ‘code’ command in PATH”\nRestart your terminal for changes to take effect\n\nFor macOS:\n\nOpen VS Code\nPress Cmd+Shift+P to open the Command Palette\nType “shell command” and select “Shell Command: Install ‘code’ command in PATH”\nRestart your terminal for changes to take effect\n\n\n\nStep 3: Install Essential VS Code Extensions 🧩\nExtensions enhance VS Code with additional features. We’ll install three key extensions.\nIn VS Code, click on the Extensions icon in the sidebar (or press: Windows Ctrl+Shift+X / mac: Cmd+Shift+X).\nPython Extension\n\nSearch for “Python”\nFind the extension by Microsoft (usually the first result)\nClick “Install”\n\nGitHub Copilot\n\nSearch for “GitHub Copilot” in the Extensions marketplace\nClick “Install”\nAfter installation, sign in with your GitHub account using the account icon in the lower left sidebar\nYou’ll be prompted to authorize VS Code to use GitHub Copilot\n\nGitHub Copilot Chat\n\nSearch for “GitHub Copilot Chat” in the Extensions marketplace\nClick “Install”\nThis extension works alongside GitHub Copilot to provide conversational AI assistance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: GitHub Copilot requires a subscription, but it’s free with the GitHub Student Developer Pack you applied for in Step 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Install uv Package Manager ⚡\nuv is a fast, modern Python package manager and resolver.\nFor Windows (PowerShell):\n\nOpen PowerShell\nRun the following command:\n\npowershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c \"irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex\"\n\nRestart your PowerShell session to ensure uv is in your PATH\n\nFor macOS/Linux (Terminal):\n\nOpen Terminal\nRun the following command:\n\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\nIf your system doesn’t have curl, you can use wget:\nwget -qO- https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n\nClose and reopen your terminal to ensure uv is in your PATH\n\nVerify installation: Type uv --version in your command line interface. You should see the version number of uv displayed.\n\n\nStep 5: Initialize Your First Project\nNow let’s create a new Python project structure using uv:\n\nOpen your command line interface (PowerShell on Windows or Terminal on Mac/Linux)\nSimply type the following command directly in your command line or first navigate to the directory where you want to create your project (e.g., cd Documents)\nRun the following command to initialize a new project named “genai-app” with Python 3.11:\n\nuv init genai-app --python 3.11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat this does\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreates a new directory called genai-app\nSets up a project structure with Python 3.11\nCreates initial configuration files\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 6: Navigate to Your Project Directory 📁\nLet’s move into your newly created project directory:\ncd genai-app\nCheck the directory contents: You can use dir (Windows) or ls (macOS/Linux) to see what files were created.\n\n\nStep 7: Activate your Virtual Python Environment 🔄\nA virtual environment is an isolated space where you can install packages without affecting your global Python installation. We can create and activate this environment with:\nuv sync\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat this does\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreates a virtual environment for your project\nSets up the environment based on your project’s specifications\nThis environment is isolated from your system Python installation\n\n\n\n\nLet’s execute the example Python file main.py to make sure everything is working:\npython3 main.py\nYou should see a “Hello, world” message.\n\n\nStep 8: Install Required Packages 📦\nLet’s add some commonly used packages for AI and data science projects:\nuv add pandas python-dotenv openai gradio streamlit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat these packages do\n\n\n\n\n\n\npandas: A beginner-friendly library that helps you work with data tables (like Excel spreadsheets)\npython-dotenv: Helps keep your passwords and API keys safe by storing them in a separate file\nopenai: Connects your code to AI services like ChatGPT\ngradio: Creates simple web interfaces for your AI projects with minimal coding\nstreamlit: Turns your Python scripts into interactive web apps with just a few lines of code\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 9: Open your project in VS Code\nNow let’s open your new project in VS Code where we’ll write our code:\ncode .\nThis command tells your computer to open VS Code in your current folder (the . means “here”).\nIf this command doesn’t work, don’t worry! You can also: 1. Open VS Code manually 2. Click on “File” in the top menu 3. Select “Open Folder…” 4. Find and select your genai-app folder\n\n\nStep 10: Run Your First Python Program 🏃‍♀️\nLet’s make sure everything is working by running the example file:\npython3 main.py\nYou should see a “Hello, world!” message appear. This confirms that: 1. Your Python is working correctly 2. Your virtual environment is active 3. You’re ready to start coding!\n\n\nTroubleshooting Common Issues 🔧\nPackage Installation Problems\nIf you see errors when adding packages:\n\nCheck that you’re connected to the internet\nTry running uv sync again to refresh your environment\nRead the error message carefully - it often tells you exactly what went wrong\n\n“Command Not Found” Error\nIf your computer can’t find the uv command:\n\nClose your terminal completely and open a new one\nIf that doesn’t work, you might need to add uv to your PATH (the list of places your computer looks for programs)\nAs a last resort, try reinstalling using the commands from Step 4\n\nVS Code Extensions Not Working\nIf the extensions we installed aren’t behaving correctly:\n\nMake sure you’ve signed in to your GitHub account in VS Code\nTry updating VS Code to the latest version\nYou can reinstall extensions by uninstalling them first, then installing again\n\n\n\nAdditional Resources 📖\n\nuv Documentation\nVS Code Python Tutorial\n\n\n\nConclusion 🎯\nCongratulations! You’ve successfully set up a Python development environment using uv. This modern setup will serve you well as you progress in your programming journey. Remember that learning to code is a marathon, not a sprint – take your time to understand each concept thoroughly.\nHappy coding! 💻✨",
